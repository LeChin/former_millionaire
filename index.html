          <div class="modal-body">
            <h3>(1) Acceptance of Terms</h3>
            <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of this site and its services ("Services"). Your access to and use of the Services are conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms. As used in these Terms, "we", "our", and "us" means United Posi Enterprises of America&trade; ("UPEA") unless otherwise indicated.</p>

            <h3>(2) Who We Are</h3>
            <p>UPEA is an Oregon nonprofit association. Future Former Millionaire&trade; is a program of UPEA.</p>

            <h3>(3) Donations</h3>
            <p>UPEA is currently not a 501(c)(3) organization and, consequently, donations to UPEA are not tax deductible at this time. Your donation through the Services is a gift to UPEA and is not tax deductible. UPEA will use the gift in its sole discretion to further its mission. UPEA shall have no liability for any claim by any federal or state tax authority with respect to any characterization by you on any applicable federal or state tax return. Gifts to UPEA are immediate and irrevocable, which means UPEA cannot cancel your donation and you do not have any rights in the gift, including UPEA's use of the gift, upon donation.</p>

            <h3>(4) Features and Services</h3>
            <p>We retain the right to restrict the use of the Services for any reason and at any time. When using the Services, you may be subject to any additional posted guidelines or rules applicable to specific media, services, and features, which may be posted from time to time ("Guidelines"). All such Guidelines are hereby incorporated by references into these Terms.</p>

            <h3>(5) Modifications to the Terms</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms at any time and without notice to you. Please check these Terms and any Guidelines periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services after the posting of changes constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes. For any material changes to these terms, such amended terms shall automatically be effective after they are initially posted on the Services.</p>

            <h3>(6) Our Proprietary Material</h3>
            <p>UPEA and its licensors shall retain all intellectual property rights in the software, data, design, tools, and any other material or content developed or provided by UPEA pursuant to these Terms including but not limited to the Services and all data, information, pictures, videos, text, sound, graphics, logos, marks, symbols, digital materials, and any and all other content provided by UPEA.</p>

            <h3>(7) Indemnification</h3>
            <p>You agree at your expense to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless UPEA and its affiliates from any claim, action, or demand, and associated costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, arising out of your use of the Services or violation of these Terms.</p>

            <h3>(8) Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
            <p>Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of UPEA and its affiliates, related companies, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the "UPEA Parties"). Each of the sections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.</p>
            <p>Your access to and use of the Services are at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, THE UPEA PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
            <p>The UPEA Parties make no warranty and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i) the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security, or reliability of the Services; (ii) any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services; and (iii) whether the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the UPEA Parties or through the Services, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.</p>

            <h3>(9) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
            <p>NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; AND NEITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR SERVICES WILL EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY DONATED TO UPEA UNDER THESE TERMS.</p>

            <h3>(10) Miscellaneous</h3>
            <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and UPEA ("Parties") with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements and representations between the Parties with respect thereto. The Parties represent and warrant that each has full power and authority to enter into these Terms and to effect the transactions contemplated herein. These Terms may not be amended, modified, or altered in any manner, unless such amendment, modification, or alteration is in writing and signed by the Parties. The failure of UPEA to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Oregon, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles. These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
            <p>The effective date of these Terms is August 27, 2014. These Terms were written in English (US). To the extent any translated version of these Terms conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.</p>
